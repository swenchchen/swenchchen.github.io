## Biography

Dr. Xuequan Chen was born in mainland China. He received the B.Eng. degree (Honors) from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2014. After that, he joined <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/condensedmatt/ultrafastphotonics/emmasthzgroup/">Prof. Emma Pickwell-MacPherson's Terahertz group</a> in the Chinese University of Hong Kong for his PhD research. His PhD focuses on improving system and algorithm design for fast and accurate terahertz spectroscopy, ellipsometry and imaging for material science and biomedical applications, and developing optical devices for terahertz intensity and phase modulation. Xuequan Chen awarded the Impact Postdoctoral Fellowship and worked as a postdoctoral fellow in the Chinese University of Hong Kong to continue his research after receiving his Ph.D. degree in 2018. He is now a research fellow in the Great Bay Area Branch of Aerospace Information Research Institute, CAS. Dr. Chen's research interests include terahertz functional devices, spectroscopic and imaging system designs, in vivo or ex vivo biomedical applications.
